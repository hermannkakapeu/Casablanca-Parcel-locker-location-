In our study, conducted within the Moroccan context, we adopt a thorough methodology to strategically determine optimal parcel locker locations. 
This involves integrating clustering techniques based on attractors, population density, and surface area, utilizing the Huff model. 
By combining these factors, we aim to improve the precision and contextual relevance of our location selection process. 
Our approach provides a comprehensive and effective strategy for identifying the most suitable locations within the Moroccan last-mile delivery landscape.
